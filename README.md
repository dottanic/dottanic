### I'm the bench boy! I'm the one who **SITS**!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ü•™ : My name is Dottie! You may know me as the **Titkok** skin at docks.

ü•û : My pronouns are she/her, but I really don't care. I like to refer to myself with masculine honorifics.

**My pet peeve is when you mfs sit in the MIDDLE of benches. They are big enough for TWO people so if you sit in the middle of them ALONE, I WILL sit next to you no matter how close, I DON'T CARE!!**

üç∞ : I'm mostly AFK, but I also watch :eye::eye:. Feel free to interact! I'll try my best to respond.

üêå : I don't have TT/TD so you can do whatever you want to me. I'll just hide you if you're really pushing it
