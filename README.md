🐙 : I'm mostly AFK, but I also watch :eye::eye:. Feel free to interact! I'll try my best to respond.

🍣 : I like cuddles! I don't have TT/TD so you can do whatever you want to me. I'll just hide you if you're really pushing it.
> I'm not gonna respond if you continuosly boop me, use your words.

🥩 : If you think "do not take inspiration from my skins!" is a reasonable thing to say then you're entitled and delusional. I'm gonna take *sooo* much inspiration from your skins out of spite.

:circus_tent: : Sign my guestbook! Write whatever you want on there: https://dottanic.123guestbook.com/

🖍️ : My skins are OCs and Cosplay and does not represent what I actually look like unless stated otherwise. I am a lightskin Southeast Asian.

DNI proshippers. Proudly calling yourself a proshipper is weird as hell. However, I don't view you as a bad person if you **keep** it contained in your **fantasy**. I'll probably block you though.
> except for pedophilia tho, its on SIGHT

DNI if you think you are morally superiour then proshippers. Unless said proshipper actively harmed someone, it doesn't warrant you to bully/doxx/harrass others, you just want to put others down without feeling bad as a person even though you are a sad, sad husk of a person.
> if this pisses you off, go touch grass. if youre gonna bully me for this, you just proved my point.

DNI edtwt people
> get well soon

DNI if you think femboy and traps are genuine slurs, it's not. It's just incredibly rude to call transwomen that.

-----------
DNI if you are a Kylo Ren enjoyer lol. IDC how much of a dykefaggottranny whore you are, he's nothing but a racist cishet man to me. He's racist and he hates trans people and he quite literally commits genocide and probably would not like you. Come with me to the better world of stormjedipilot instead ✌️
> on a serious note, i just hate what his character stands for, a cockblock for Rey and Finn's position as mainstream Star Wars' beloved protagonists. We cannot have a strong female jedi and a black jedi without a white man hogging the spotlight apparently,,, also if you are a true faggot then you would be into FinnPoe, just saying
