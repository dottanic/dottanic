### I'm the bench boy! I'm the one who **SITS**!
🥪 : My name is Dottie!

🥞 : My pronouns are she/her, but I really don't care. I like to refer to myself with masculine titles.

**My pet peeve is when you mfs sit in the MIDDLE of benches. They are big enough for TWO people so if you sit in the middle of them ALONE, I WILL sit next to you no matter how close, I DON'T CARE!!**

🍰 : I'm mostly AFK, but I also watch :eye::eye:. Feel free to interact! I'll try my best to respond.

🐌 : I don't have TT/TD so you can do whatever you want to me. I'll just hide you if you're really pushing it.
